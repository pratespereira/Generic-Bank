# SOLID

**SOLID is an acronym that stands for five principles of object-oriented programming and design. They are:**


## Single Responsibility Principle:

A class should have only one reason to change. This principle states that a class should have only one responsibility and that this responsibility should be encapsulated within the class.

## Open-Closed Principle:

A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle states that a class should be designed in such a way that it can be extended without modifying the class itself. This allows for new functionality to be added to the class without making changes to the original class.

## Liskov Substitution Principle:

Subtypes should be able to replace their parent types without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle:

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn't use. Classes should only be required to implement the methods that they actually use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle:

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. This means that the high-level module should not know about the details of the low-level module and should only know about the abstraction. This makes the system more flexible and easier to change.
#
 **These principles are intended to help developers create more maintainable and flexible software.**
